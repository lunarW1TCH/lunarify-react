Hello, this is a React app which utilizes Spotify API to show user's top listened-to artists and albums.
There's also a React Native version: https://github.com/lunarW1TCH/lunarify-react-native

Technologies used:
 - React
 - TypeScript
 - Redux Toolkit
 - i18next
 - Spotify API
 - OAuthFlow
### App is currently not publicly available to browse through since that would require me to reach out to Spotify for extended quota usage of their API which I do not want to do at the moment.
(Feel free to look through/clone/fork the code though!)

Here are some screens I took:
